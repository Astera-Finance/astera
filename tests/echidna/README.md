# Fuzzing tests with Echidna/Medusa

Echidna is a program designed for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smart contracts. Please refer to the doc for [installation](https://github.com/crytic/echidna#installation).

```sh
forge install
echidna tests/echidna/PropertiesMain.sol --contract PropertiesMain --config tests/echidna/config/config1_fast.yaml
```

Medusa: to be fixed.
```sh
cd tests/echidna
medusa fuzz --config medusa_config.json
```

You can fine in `/echidna` 3 config files to run the fuzzer:

- 1< min | `config1_fast.yaml`
- 5< min | `config2_slow.yaml`
- 50 min | `config3_inDepth.yaml`

- Implemente all "To implement" invariants.
- Fix randBorrow "207", "220", "221".

- Add rewarders.
- test setDepositCap
- fix lastLiquidityIndex and lastBorrowIndex

# Invariant testing

### General (same for the LendingPool and MiniPools)

100. ✅ To be liquidated on a given collateral asset, the target user must own the associated `aTokenColl`.
101. ✅ To be liquidated on a given token, the target user must own the associated `vTokenDebt`.
102. ✅ `liquidationCall()` must only be callable when the target health factor is < 1.
103. ✅ `liquidationCall()` must decrease the target `vTokenDebt` balance by `amount`.
104. ✅ `liquidationCall()` must increase the liquidator `aTokenColl` (or `collAsset`) balance.
105. ✅ `liquidationCall()` must decrease the liquidator debt asset balance if `randReceiveAToken` is true or `collAsset` is not equal to `debtAsset`.
